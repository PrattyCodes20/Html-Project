<h2>Seeing Aurora Borealis was my biggest bucklet list item</h2>
<P>In Feb 2024, before this fateful diagnosis of my son, we did an amazing trip to Europe and we could see these beautiful Northern Lights in 
  Tromso

<h3>How to get to see the Norther Lights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Plan a trip to the Arctic Region</li>
  <li>Book a place away from the city lights</li>
  <li>Alternatively, hire a car and try to get away from the city lights</li>
  <li>Install an Aurora Finder App and chase!</li>
</ul>
