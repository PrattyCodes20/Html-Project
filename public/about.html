<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>I am Pratyusha, mom of a 3.3 years old healthy toddler and a Technical Product Manager by profession.</p>

<p>I am strong individual, both physically and mentally. I love to cook and bake. I love to keep learning and taking on new challenges.
  I have a penchant towards artistic things and art in general, but not really an active artist myself. I am a very social person and love
  to keep in touch with people and meetover for a coffee or meal, but importantly I love to invite people to my place and cook a special 
  meal for them.

  I also spend my free time with my kid, teaching him new stuff everyday and taking him out to clean and green places. After his Blood Leukemia diagnosis, 
  last year has been pretty busy with his consultations and hospital visits. But this year is quite relaxing with him being cured completely
  without a trace of the demonic c****r cell. He is doing great and is back to the charming and loving self, that he always has been.

<P>I am really thankful that our manifestation for Moksh's healing is working wonderfully!</P>
